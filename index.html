    <h2>Significance</h2>
        <p>The Pettit Barn retains the requisite integrity of design and materials, and the frame, its most important feature as a utilitarian agricultural structure, is largely intact. The barn clearly is a representative example of its type and of traditional braced-frame construction and, in a local context as Brick Township rapidly losses the vestiges of its rural past to rapid suburban development, has significance as a rare surviving example. In the larger context of coastal New Jersey, the barn is an important example of the use of ship-building materials in non-marine construction. Authorities on the region's vernacular architecture and water craft have indicated that there appears to have been a tradition of such practices, but that examples are rare. A hotel (no longer extant) and a house in hat is now Island Beach State Park are said to have been constructed from ship timbers. An examination of pertinent historic site surveys and cultural resource assessments suggests that the Pettit Barn is the only known New Jersey example of this practice in the construction of agricultural buildings. On another level the Pettit Barn sheds light on the widespread tradition of the construction of house by shipwrights; it provides clear evidence not of shipwrights buildings houses, but of the use of ship-building materials in a non-marine context.</p>

        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>This addendum explains the structural choices made in encoding the academic paper into HTML.</p>

        <h3>HTML Structure and Tags Used</h3>
        <p>The paper is divided into several sections using HTML5 <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tags to represent different parts such as Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, and References. This helps in creating a clear hierarchy and makes the content more readable.</p>

        <p>The <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tag is used to display tabular data in the Results section, which is structured with <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> elements to organize data clearly.</p>

        <p>Styling is done using internal CSS to maintain readability and a clean layout, with appropriate margins, font styles, and table formatting.</p>
